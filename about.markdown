# About Me
Ellen is a senior studying statistics at Brigham Young University. Her Honors thesis (ongoing) explored which method - log-rank or Prentice-modified Wilcoxon - most accurately models the true difference between two groups given a simulated dataset that involves left truncation. After graduation, she plans to take a gap year before getting her master's and potentially going on to a Ph.D in either statistics or biostatistics. Her interests include linguistic computing, music, and D&D, but she nerds out the most over learning new computing/statistical skills and watching patterns come out of data.
