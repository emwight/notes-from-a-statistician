description: Stories of art crimes, while not the most-viewed subgenre of true crime, still capture national attention. This post shows how accessible the FBI art crime API is, and a possible way to clean the data for future analysis.

## Introduction
Look at the empty frames below, or imagine yourself in the place of the museum patron. What do you see?

In 2013, French artist Sophie Callie posed [this question](https://aperture.org/editorial/what-do-you-see/) to visitors of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Both that project and her previous work _Last Seen_ (in which she instead interviewed museum employees) explored the cultural and artistic loss from a [theft in 1990](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft), which involved thirteen works of art and still remains unsolved. The FBI is still working on this case and many others
**FINISH**

The FBI has readily-available data on these art thefts through its [API](https://api.fbi.gov/docs#!/), which doesn't even require an API key. The same data is listed on their [Stolen Art File website](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file), but in a much less accessible format as far as web scraping is concerned. 

**FINISH: how i got data in the first place**

## The Good
 - process for everything except period and measurements

## The Bad
 - period

## The Ugly
 - turning measurements into size (w/ units)
