description: Stories of art crimes, while not the most-viewed subgenre of true crime, still capture national attention. This post shows how accessible the FBI art crime is and a possible way to clean the data for future analysis.

## Introduction
Imagine walking through a museum and entering a room full of frames like the ones pictured below. What do you see?

In 2013, French artist Sophie Callie posed [this question](https://aperture.org/editorial/what-do-you-see/) to visitors of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Both that project and her previous work _Last Seen_ (in which she instead interviewed museum employees) explored the cultural and artistic loss from a [theft in 1990](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft), which involved thirteen works of art and still remains unsolved. **FINISH**

## Data Collection

First, some ethical considerations about getting data off the web. Some sites forbid web scraping due to privacy or other concerns, and the last thing we want is to become thieves ourselves while obtaining art theft data. Some companies and organizations, however, provide an API, which is an ethical and user-friendly way to bridge the gap between website and extracted data. The FBI, for instance, has readily-available data on its [national stolen art file](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file) through its [API](https://api.fbi.gov/docs#!/) and doesn't even require an API key.

### Requests and Beautiful Soup

## Data Cleaning

### The Good
 - process for everything except period and measurements

### The Bad
 - period

### The Ugly
 - turning measurements into size (w/ units)
